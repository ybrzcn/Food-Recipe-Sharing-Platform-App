# Food Recipe Sharing Platform App

Recipe Sharing Platform

I am developing a recipe-sharing platform that not only provides users with personalized recipe suggestions but also includes features of a small-scale social media platform. The goal is to enrich the user experience and create a more interactive environment.

Backend:
	•	Designed with two separate layers: Library and API.
	•	Built using .NET 9 and MSSQL.

Frontend:
	•	Developed using React, while I continue learning and enhancing my React skills.

This platform is designed to offer a unique combination of recipe sharing and social interaction, making it both functional and engaging.
